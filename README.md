Basic Introductions
  This is an app developed by SmileGuide.
  It has special fuctions for educators to correct students' papers online ,
and can also be used as a picture-processing app. 
Original Ideas
  The thought of developing an app for teachers on my own occured to me for the first time when I was in Grade Seven,
and when my junior high school teachers working hard online to correct test papers, during the hard period after COVID-19 pandemic bursted out.
  I spent two weeks coding in my spare time, as well as extending the functions to make it a more useful processing app for pictures,
and I do want educators to use this Drawing board to work more easily.
